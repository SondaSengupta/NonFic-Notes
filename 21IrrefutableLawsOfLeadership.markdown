# 5 - The Law of Addition : Leaders Add Value By Serving Others

The one critical question a leader should ask: "Are you making things better for the people who follow you?"
Depending upon the evidence to back it up, you are either an adder or a subtractor.

We add value to others when we:
- Truly value others and show it.
- Make ourselves more valuable to others. The more you continue to pursue personal growth, the more you will continue to offer.
- Know and relate to what others value. "Inexperienced leaders are quick to lead before knowing anything about the people they intend to lead. Maute leaders listen to other's people's stories, their hopes and dreams, and pay attention to their emotions. They learn about their people and what is valuable to them."
- Have an attitude of service that treats people as decent human beings.

### To Your Life:
- Do you have a servant's attitude towards leadership? When others need something, do you instead respond with impatience, resentment, or feel like it lacks your time or position? Make it a practice to perform acts of service without credit and recognition.
- Make a list of what each person around you values most? How well can you relate with their values. If you can't relate very well, spend more time with the person to impove this.
- Make adding value a part of your lifestyle. See what your closest people value and start adding to it.

# 6 - The Law of Solid Ground: Trust is the Foundation of Leadership

Trust is the most important thing and the foundation of leadership, the glue that holds an organization together.

"Your people know when you make mistakes. The real question is whether you're going to fess up. If you do, you can often regain their trust."

Trust is like change in a leader's pocket. Each time you make good decisions, you earn more change. Bad ones, take away change. If leaders make on bad decision after another, they keep paying out change, until at last it's too late, and you're out as a leader. In contrast, good leaders who have a record of wins build up change, and even after a huge blunder, they have plenty of leftover change and can regain trust quickly.

Build trust by consistently exemplifying competence, connection, and character. "People tolerate honest mistakes, but if you violate their trust, it is difficult to regain confidence. You may fool your boss but you can never fool your colleagues and subordinates." Character makes trust possible. Character communicates consistency through inner strength that can be counted on day after day. Character communicates potential. Weak character is limiting and good character has greater potential. Character communicates respect.
