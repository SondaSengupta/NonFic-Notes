## Ch. 4 : Getting The Right Credit Card
- Some waive the yearly fee as an introductory offer.
- New credit only accounts for 10% of your FICO score, so as long as your strong in other areas it won't hurt your score. You can open and close accounts yearly.
- Ideally space your applications several months apart.

#### What makes a good credit card?
- One that offers at least 20,000 bonus points for signing up. Normal is 30,000 points. That is about one round-trip domestic flight.
- Branded cards give you elite loyalty status for brand loyalty which means Hilton Gold Status for free rooms, Starwood status for free airline lounges, etc.
- A huge sign up bonus, extra points (or more for buying specific things), low spending minimum (less than $1,000). 
- The majority of fees charge 3 percent when used overseas. Credit cards are usually good to use because they have a good exchange rate. The Capital One No Hassle Card he uses exclusively overseas because it has no foreign transaction fees (even though he says the rewards structure is terrible). Get one that has no foreign transaction fees that will also give you some rewards so that you can use it overseas.
- If you are only after points best overall cards: Capital One No Hassle Reward, Chase Saphire and Ink Cards, or American Express.

## Ch. 5: Airline Tickets
- There are two options for flying: buy a round-the-world ticket before you go or pay for your flight as you fly from point to point.

#### Round the World (RTW) Air Tickets
- This is where you prebook all your flights ahead of time. They usually offer 29,000 to 40,000 mileage increments (29K will get you 3 continents outside US). Usually require a set number of stopovers, but can't change destinations without paying an extra fee.
- Airline Alliances:  
  **Star Alliances:** big alliances that includes United. RTW here includes 15 stopovers, require you to start and end in same country, no backtracking over oceans, any travel counts as mileage, flexible dates.
  **Oneworld:** smaller than Star Alliance but more flexible ticket rules. Includes American Airlines and British Airways. The best RTW is Oneworld Explorer based on number of continents, no max mileage, sixteen flight segments.
  **SkyTeam:** Smallest for Europe and Asia so limited options for RTW.
  -None of these alliances include smaller budget airlines or regional airlines, so if you take tickets here, you can't use them creating a RTW.

**AirTrek.com:** A third party such as AirTreks will create a round the world kind of pass by piecing together individual airline tickets based on the lowest available fares it can find, mixing and matching alliances. Thus, Alliance RTW rules don't applay; however, the dates are not flexible, operating just like you would getting a bunch of regular airline tickets.

#### How to Find Cheap Point-To-Point Flights
This is the main way the author travels. Why? Most flexible, especially if you decide to change your mind about destinations. You can use points for a lot more of your flights. Use a lot of budget airlines, though make sure you know the fees because there are a lot (weight limit on baggage, copies of your pass, convenience fee for using a credit card).

**Be Flexible with Airline Plans:** Cheaper to fly during the middle of the week, rather than weekend. August is a big vacation month for Europe. Cheaper after a major holiday. Cheaper early morning or late at night. Make sure to check surrounding dates.

**Fly into Secondary Airports:** Figure out transportation from the airport to city center. Sometimes, flying into a cheaper smaller airport is better with a budget airline. 

**Use More Search Engines:** There is Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz but there is also Booking Buddy, Dohop, Hipmunk, Kayak, Momondo (Denmark site for global searches), Skyscanner (for budget airlines), and Vayama. And Google Flights. Look at multiple sites since they have blind spots. He starts with SkyScanner and Momondo and branch out into Kayak, Hipmunk, Vayama, and Expedia. If there is a lot of variance, he keeps searching, but if prices are within 10 dollars of each other, you know that it will probably be the same on other sites.

Students get discounts. STA Travel is exclusively for student, teachers, and under twenty-six. 

Other Tricks:  
1. When flying, use airline reward programs to get free flights, upgrades, etc.
2. Shop at major stores because all airlines have special offers with major stores if you shop online via an airline's website.  Just log into the frequent-flyer account, click "shop with partners".

3. Watch for special offers by signing up for newsletters. Stay on top of twitter feeds and newletter for airlines. For example, Jet Blue is famouse for Tuesday Twitter fare sales: **Airfare Watchdog** His Favorite. **Kayak** ,**Momondo**, all offer newsletters.

4. You can get crazy and do mileage runs. You can see people doing that on Flyertalk where an airline offers triple points or something if you do a certain route.

5. Put everything on your points card. "I don't do anything if it doesn't benefit my miles account." Think like that.

6. Check airport's website to see what airlines fly into it so you can see smaller cheaper flights.

Best recommendation is combining point-to-point method with frequent flyer miles. "If you manage to get one travel credit card with a large sign-up bonus, you can use those miles to get a free flight. Then using budget airlines and those tips, you can reduce your flight costs even further."

## Ch 6: Buying a Backpack

A backpack is something you can just sling on your back and don't need to lug across streets or up stairs. Suitcases are for staying one place for a long time, but for any sort of travel versatility, a backpack is better.

#### Choosing the Right Backpack
- Semi-waterproof so it doesn't get soaked. Many come with a tarp you can put on it. Thick but lightweight. If you put a cup of water on it, the inside is fine.
- Each compartment has two zippers so you can lock it with TSA-friendly locks. Pacsafe is a mesh material that you can buy to "lock" your bag all at once, though it's heavy to carry around. Photographers are the ones usually getting Pacsafe.
- Multiple compartments.
- Internal Frame because they are lighter.
- Padded Hip Belt
- Padded Shoulder Straps
- Chest Strap
- Countered, Padded Back that creates a small space between your back and bag allowing air to circulate to stay cool.
- Get a size that is big enough to hold just a bit more stuff than the stuff you are bringing. The bigger the backpack, the less likely you can carry on a plane. Remember if you have liquids more than 3 oz, you will be forced to check in this bag.
- $200 is really the most you should pay. The higher end has many bells and whistles that aren't worth it. Buy last year's model at a discounted price at REI, Backcountry, Sierra Trading Post, or Campmor. Visit the store to try it on (or around 10 more backpacks). 

He uses an REI Mars pack for the last 7 years and generally like REI for products overall.

## Ch 7: Travel Insurance
Most insurance doesn't cover you overseas, so get travel insurance to protect your health. Be sure to check if your medical insurance extends to overseas travel. Check your credit card to see if you have insurance coverage for the goods you buy. Then, shop around for gaps.

The most important part of travel insurance is medical coverage. Good insurance has 2 things: a high coverage limit for medical expenses of about $100,000 that can cover your hospital stay and preexisting conditions. Second, make sure it covers emergency evacuation to a hospital, like say you break your leg while hiking. If a natural disaster happens and you need to be evacuated to somewhere else, it should also cover you, usually up to $300,000. Emergency evacuation also means from the hospital to your home country. Double-check these things.

**Factors in Choosing:**
- covers most countries in the world and all that you are visiting. Read the list of covered countries before deciding.
- 24 hours emergency services and assistance
- coverage for lost, damaged, or stolen possessions. Its important to know your insurance will give you money to buy new supplies so you aren't stuck.
- cancellation protection for things like hotel bookings, flights, and transportation.
- family emergency coverage. If a  family member dies or suddenly gets ill, you'll want know there is coverage so your flight home is paid for.
- personal accident coverage
- coverage for legal expenses
- financial protection. If your tour company or airlines goes bust, ensure you're covered up to $10,000 USD. This is a new addition so you may have to shop around.
- most electronics only are covered to $500, so you may need supplemental insurance to cover that.

Make sure that you know what is NOT covered in your plan too -- like covering extreme adventure activities like hang gliding, bungee jumping, or if you injure someone on the road. Or for being drunk or reckless. Unless there is a state department warning advising travelers away, your trip cancellation usually won't cover you. Know the exclusions.

#### Websites and Resources
Insure My Trip (www.insuremytrip.com) is good for comparing policies.
STA Travel Insurance
World Nomads
MedEx
MedjetAssist

Generally, insurance is between $600 and 1,000 per year per person with a policy that begins the day you purchase it.

#### Making a claim
They will try to avoid paying you as much as they can. Make sure you keep all your reciepts while traveling and the necessary forms. Keep anything that you may use to file a claim.

When filing a claim, keep a running journal of the date/times, who you talked to, outcomes of phone calls, emails sent, and legwork to keep track.

His favorite is World Nomads because a lot can be done online, friendly staff, and have a track record of positive feedback. They are also more expensive though.

## Ch. 8: Get a Travel Discount Card
Travel discount cards save money on hostels, airfare, transportation and tours. Some are for students but some anyone can get. In general, the cheaper the country, the less likely you can use the card. 

**Cards:**
- ISIC (International Student Identity Card): A student card you can find through isic.org and is about 22 dollars. Only for full time students no matter the age. Another version is for teachers and under 26. Lots of discounts in Europe.
- YHA (Youth Hostel Asociation): Provides 10 percent discount on worldwide hostel chains. Buy before you fly since its priced depending on country.
- VIP (General Purpose for Australia and New Zealand): costs around 43 dollars but can be used in multiple countries in major hostels and doubles as a international phone card. Especially in Australia and New Zealand.
- BBH (Budget Backpacker Hostels): About $37 but if you are staying extended in Australia and New Zealand, pays for itself.
- Nomad Card: focused on Nomads Hostels and partners. You can get the 7th night free and 2 dollars of all other nights.

## Ch. 9: What to Do with Your Stuff
- Long Trips, sell everything you own. Or put it in a storage facility.
- Sign up for automatic bill pay
- Use only one credit card on the road so only worry about one credit bill. 
- Most banks you can set up bill pay to things, even your mortgage.
- Sign up for paperless statements to get less mail. Or ask a trusted person to check your mail for you once in a while. Like making your parents trusted users on credit cards to troubleshoot problems.
- Earth Class Mail scans your mail and you choose what to do with it: scan and view the mail, recycle it, ship it somewhere else. Costs $10/month.

## Ch. 10: The Savings Mindset
You don't need to splurge every day to "experience the culture". In fact, you do just opposite; live like the locals.

We need to look for value when we travel. It's not about the first offer you see, but doing research and planning. You can anticipate a lot of your costs if you know what you want to spend money on.

Write in a journal exactly what you are spending your money on during a trip so you can stay within budget.

## Ch. 11: Tips for Saving Money on Accommodations

#### Hospitality Exchange
Sites that connect people to stay a night no strings attached with the expectation that one day, you will do the same.
- Couchsurfing.com:  Membership free. Millions of members. Make a comprehensive profile and people can give ratings. Twenties and Thirties age.
- Servas: Oldest one and recognized by the UN. Requires two letters of reference, a personal interview with a coordinator, and a membership free. After an interview, good for one year. Mainly for baby boomers and up.
- Hospitality Club: Second largest. Free membership, but needs verification from club volunteers. You can leave reviews.
- Global Freeloaders: Used in Australia. Free membership, but your required to host someone within 6 months of being hosted.

His recommendation is Couchsurfing.com.  "If a person on the site has at least 3 references, then you know you can trust them." Criteria:
- profile picture.
- profile filled out completely.
- reviews from other users
- gotten verification from couchsurfing.com, not necessary if enough positive reviews.

He usually sends an email letting the host know information about him, why they would have a good time, and planned dates. In return, he will cook a meal. He emails 5-10 potential hosts. Try to ask at least a week in advance.

#### Farm Work
You can use WWOOFing or World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms in which you work for board. Membership usually costs around $30 per country and you go to the country's site to look at participating farms. The expectation is you volunteer 5 hours a day, five days a week and they will accomodate you. No prior farm experience is needed.

#### Name Your Own Hotel Price
A number of websites can give you last minute deals for hotels:
- LateRooms
- Last Minute
- Hotel Tonight
- Priceline
- Hotwire
- Better Bidding is a forum where people put in their most successful bids
- Bidding on Travel
- Bid on Travel
He finds Priceline and Hotwire to be the best. They each have two sections: one where you bid on price, and another for just discounted hotels. For the auction, it's basically a blind auction. You don't know exactly what you are going to get until you book.

#### House Sitting
This is where you get to stay in someone's house while they are gone but you take care of the home, pets, and other chores as needed. Some sites are:
- House Cares: Popular in Australia and New Zealand. $50 membership fee.
- Mind My House: More for US, Europe, and Australia. Smaller site but $20.
- The Caretaker Gazette: Oldest housesitting organization $30/year

Make sure you do research on the house and determine EXACTLY what your responsibilities are agreed upon in legal contract. 

#### Hostels
Two largest sites are:
- HostelWorld
- HostelBookers

#### Service Apartments
Service apartments are owned, furnished, and taken care of by someone else but you rent like you would a hotel room. People list an extra room, couch, or property they own and want to make money by inviting guests to stay over.

- 9flats : Good in Europe
- Airbnb: largest site with strongest inventory
- Homeaway
- Roomorama
- Wimdu : Airbnb largest competitor

## Ch. 12: Tips for Saving Money on Food and Beverages
- Cook your own meals. Majority of hostels, guesthouses, and shared apartments have full kitchens with pots and such to cook. You can tell a lot about the food culture by seeing what's most around at the supermarket
- Lunch Specials: Just ask hotel/hostel staff or tourist offices
- Refill your water bottle: Water in every western/modern country is safe for consumption. You can use Steripen to purify water in unsafe countries.
- Never eat in a touristy area: Go explore some side streets and places you don't hear a lot of English. Look on Yelp, Urbanspoon, or ask for recommendations.

## Ch. 13: Tips for Saving Money on Transportation
- Take Local Transportation: forget coaches, taxies, and tourist buses. It's more fun to figure out the local transportation system. 
- Get a train pass: You can get one for a set number of rides, unlimited rides for set number of days.
- Buy Metro Fare Cards: Instead of buying a ticket for each point-to-point, buy a number of fares with a metro card. Consider this if you are staying more than 2 days. Just ask the tourism office, metro station, or hostel.

## Ch. 14: Tips for Saving Money on Activities
- Get Tourism Cards: Local tourism offices issue cards for a lot of attractions and restaurants. You pay a onetime fee for substantial discounts and valid for a number of days. Like the VisitOslo card for Oslo Norway, or the London Pass in London. If you are doing sight-seeing, get a card!
- Free museum days: before you go anywhere, make sure you look on the museum to see if there are any free/discounted visiting hours.
- Use discount cards: Don't forget the hostel discount cards, student travel discount cards. Go to the local tourist office and check advertisements. Head to the information booth at the transportation hub and ask where the tourism office is.
